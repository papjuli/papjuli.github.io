Welcome to my home page!

My name is Julia, I'm a software engineer with math background. I'm based in Zürich, Switzerland.

Recently I worked at [Archilogic](https://www.archilogic.com/) as a machine learning engineer, working on automation projects related to digital interior spaces (check out some demos [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/archilogic-ag/)).

Earlier, I worked in the [Data Mining and Search Group](https://dms.sztaki.hu/en) of [MTA SZTAKI](http://www.sztaki.hu/?en) (Institute for Computer Science and Control of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences), starting to move into coding and data science.

In the past I worked as a research assistant at [Egerváry Research Group (EGRES)](http://www.cs.elte.hu/egres) at the [Operations Research Department](http://www.cs.elte.hu/opres/index2.html) of the [Mathematics Institute](http://www.cs.elte.hu/) of Eötvös University, Budapest.
My main research area was polyhedral combinatorics and complexity questions regarding linear systems. I also worked on topics in combinatorial optimization, graph theory and game theory, such as stable matchings or games on multicommodity flows.

<!-- I completed my PhD in 2013 under the supervision of [András Frank](http://www.cs.elte.hu/~frank). The title of my thesis is "Integrality, complexity and colourings in polyhedral combinatorics". -->
