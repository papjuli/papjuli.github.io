### Rubber band method

I reimplemented a program by László Lovász that demonstrates several graph algorithms, all based on one core idea: imagining the graph as a physical object with rubber bands as edges. This concept can be used to design a variety of algorithms:
- drawing planar graphs in the plane
- testing k-connectivity
- approximating the maximum cut
- tiling rectangles with squares

Try it [here](https://papjuli.github.io/rubber-band-method/)! Like the original, it's an interactive visualization of these algorithms, alongside explanations and references. It is geared toward students and researchers interested in graph theory, but others might also enjoy playing around with it.

### Notes of ETH classes
Here are some of my notes (in Notion) on classes I've taken at ETH Zürich as part of the DAS program:

- [Computer Vision](https://rhinestone-garage-59a.notion.site/Computer-Vision-57f34e1a12e0469fa7bcc8cbed89affa) class taught by Marc Pollefeys, Siyu Tang and Fisher Yu.

- [Big Data](https://rhinestone-garage-59a.notion.site/Big-Data-for-Engineers-66c9ad0a2a6347a28368ace528966456?source=copy_link) class taught by Ghislain Fourny.
